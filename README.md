Project Title: B2TConverter - Binary to Text Converter

Information:
BinTextConverter is a simple tool designed to convert binary code into human-readable text. It takes a binary string as input and translates it into plain text using standard binary to ASCII translation. This project aims to show how binary data can be interpreted and converted back into a readable format, which is fundamental to understanding computer systems, coding and data transmission. Ideal for learning purposes, especially for those new to binary conversion and computer science.

Feature:

    Convert binary string to text (ASCII).
    User friendly input and output interface.
    Supports multiple text formats (uppercase, lowercase, etc.).
